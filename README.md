# Dream Destination

Our mission is to provide dream destinations for people who donâ€™t know where to go for vacation. This helps solve indecisiveness between families, friends, or really anyone by taking in multiple inputs to redirect to the dream destination for everyone.

Our target audience is families and friends who want to travel but have specific factors that may limit their ability to travel like budget, restriction of visa, or even confusion of where to go. Dream Destination will serve as the ultimate travel application that receives input from users in order to find the perfect location. Whether the user is planning a family vacation with children or a friendly get-together, the Dream Destination will help plan all of it!

Not only does our app account for all for all the inputs and gives the user a location perfect to their needs, it will advise the user for the best hotels, transportation, and activities appropriate and in that local area. The most important feature of Dream Destination is its ability to account for user input in order to pick out the perfect location for a trip.
